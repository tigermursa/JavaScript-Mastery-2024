/*
Implement a debounce function that delays invoking a function until after a certain amount of time has elapsed since 
the last time the function was invoked. This is often used to optimize performance by reducing the frequency of execution for 
functions that are called frequently, such as event handlers.


Closures: To maintain the state of the last invocation time.
setTimeout() and clearTimeout(): To manage the delay between function invocations.
Higher-Order Functions: Returning a function from another function, creating a debounced version.
