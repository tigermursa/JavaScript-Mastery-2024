/*
Write a function to flatten a nested array. The input array can contain nested arrays, 
and the output should be a single-level array with all the elements.



Recursion: To handle nested arrays, a recursive approach is often used to traverse through all levels of nesting.
Array Methods: Utilize array methods such as Array.isArray() and Array.prototype.concat().
