# Module 3 : Into the OOP

## Video - 2/6 : Pillars Of OOP.(4)

Abstraction:
Easy Explanation: Abstraction means focusing on the important things and ignoring the details that are not necessary right now. It's like driving a car without needing to know how the engine works inside.
Encapsulation:

Easy Explanation: Encapsulation is like putting your data (like age, name) and the actions you can do with that data (like eat, sleep) together in a box (class). It helps in keeping things organized and protected.
Inheritance:

Easy Explanation: Inheritance is like passing down traits from parents to children. In programming, it means a new group of actions and data (class) can get what another group has, making it easier to reuse and share.
Polymorphism:

Easy Explanation: Polymorphism is like using the same word in different ways. In programming, it means using the same name for actions (methods) but having them do different things based on the situation. It makes code flexible and easy to understand.
These ideas help programmers build software that is easier to understand, change, and reuse.
