# Module 3 : Into the OOP

## Video - 2/6 : Pillars Of OOP.(4)

Abstraction:

Definition: Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors they share.
Details: It allows programmers to focus on the relevant aspects of an object and ignore unnecessary details. For example, if you're designing a car class, you might abstract away the internal combustion engine's intricate workings and focus on the car's interface and functionality.
Encapsulation:

Definition: Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, often referred to as a class.
Details: This concept helps in hiding the internal details of how an object's state is managed and accessed. Encapsulation provides a way to control access to the data and protect it from unintended interference. It also promotes modularity and helps in organizing code.
Inheritance:

Definition: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class (subclass/derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors of an existing class (base class/parent class).
Details: Inheritance promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between the classes. The subclass can reuse methods and attributes of the superclass, and it can also override or extend them as needed. This helps in creating a hierarchical structure in code, where common features are in a base class and specific features are added in derived classes.
Polymorphism:

Definition: Polymorphism means "many forms" and refers to the ability of objects to be treated as instances of their parent class or as instances of their own class.
Details: Polymorphism allows a single interface to represent different types of objects. It can be achieved through method overloading (having multiple methods with the same name but different parameters) and method overriding (changing the behavior of a method in a subclass). This flexibility simplifies code and enhances its readability.
