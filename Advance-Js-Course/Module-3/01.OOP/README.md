# Module 3 : Into the OOP

## Video - 1/6 : What Is Object-Oriented Programming?

OOP is a programming paradigm (we can say a style)
JavaScript is a multi paradigm language that's mean it support OOP and FP both
OOP was developed to maintain a structured code base
Object may contain Data(property) and Functionality (methods)
In OPP, Objects are self-contained blocks of code.
Objects can interact with one another
