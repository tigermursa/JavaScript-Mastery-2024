### Object-oriented programming (OOP) in JavaScript means we organize our code by creating and using objects. Objects are like containers that hold information and actions.

#### There are two main ways to do this:

## Prototype-based OOP:

In JavaScript, we often use a prototype-based approach. This means one object can act as a model for other objects. It's like having a template for creating new objects.
Each object can be based on another object, and they share certain characteristics. Think of it like inheriting traits from a parent.


## Class-based OOP (ES6 and later):

With the introduction of ECMAScript 2015 (ES6), JavaScript made it easier to create objects using a class syntax. A class is like a blueprint for creating objects.
It simplifies the process of defining and creating objects, making the code more organized and easier to understand. It's like having a recipe to bake cookies â€“ you follow the recipe (class) to make as many cookies (objects) as you need.
