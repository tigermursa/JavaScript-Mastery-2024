### What is scope ??
"scope" defines where variables are accessible

There are global and local scopes. 
Global Scope: Variables here can be used anywhere in your program declared. 
Local Scope: Variables here only work in specific parts of your code, like inside a function or a block.

### var globalVar = "I'm global";
### let blockVar = "I'm block-scoped";
### const constantVar = "I'm constant";
