JavaScript Execution Context is like the environment where your code runs. It includes all the info about variables, functions, and where they're located. There's a global context for the entire script and individual function contexts when functions are called.

Global context is the overall environment, while function context is specific to individual functions during their execution.
The global context is executed when the script starts, and function context is executed when a function is called.
