### what is Hoisting ??
#### formal:
Hoisting in JavaScript is a behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope during compilation, allowing you to use them before they are formally declared in the code.
#### Casual

Hoisting in JavaScript is like the language moving declarations (of variables and functions) to the top of your code behind the scenes, so you can use them even before writing them explicitly. It's like the language lifts them up.
