## Video - 3/5 : JS Engine and Runtime at the core

### What is js Engine and how it's works?

The Full js code execution handle the js engine, That engine name is V8 engine,

Code > Browser > Parsing > AST > Compilation > Execution

### What is JavaScript Runtime?

Runtime basically nothing but the environment , like when we run in web then the runtime is the browser .
and when want er run the code in our local machine then the runtime is node.js . As Simple as that

# So Runtime = Browser = Engine + Web APIs

## Summary of the video

#### JS Engine

So, JavaScript uses the V8 engine to perform its execution job. The entire process of executing the code includes:
Code > Browser > Parsing > AST > Compilation > Execution.

#### JS Runtime

The runtime is the environment where overall processes happen. It's like our PC, and the V8 engine is the CPU. Got it? Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows us to run JavaScript on our beautiful local machine.
