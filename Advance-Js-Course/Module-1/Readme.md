### Video -1 : What is JavaScript ?

#### High Abstraction :

Don't gives us full or all control , JS manage it behind the scene.and doesn't need any resource management and memory allocation.
We don't have to worry about memory allocation!

#### Garbage Collected :

It means that we don't need to worry about garbage cleanup. An algorithm inside JavaScript take care of garbage collection and cleaning!

#### JIT compiled:

JavaScript is not purely interpreted language ,
rather modern js is Just in time compiled = JIT.
So we can say js is a mix with interpreted and compiled

#### Multi-paradigm:

Paradigm: Mindset of code structure which will determine your coding style.
1.Procedural Programming
2.OOP
3.FP:Functional Programming

#### Prototyped-based:

prototype is kind of blueprint ,Like we use array.map right?
here js Array have Array.prototype.map , and Array's all methods like .pop .push etc in this prototype.

#### Functions are first class citizen:

It means you can throw function anywhere you want.
we can treat function as a variable. We can pass function as a parameter of a function.
we can return function from inside of another function .This feature gives us a lot of flexibility while using function.
