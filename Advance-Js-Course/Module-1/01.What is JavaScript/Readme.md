# Module 1 : Path to machine code

## Video -1/5 : What is JavaScript ?

### High Abstraction :

Don't gives us full or all controls , JS manage it behind the scene. and doesn't need any resource management and memory allocation.
We don't have to worry about memory allocation!

### Garbage Collected :

It means that we don't need to worry about garbage cleanup. An algorithm inside JavaScript take care of garbage collection and cleaning!

### JIT compiled:

JavaScript is not purely interpreted language ,
rather modern js is Just in time compiled = JIT.
So we can say js is a mix with interpreted and compiled

### Multi-paradigm:

Paradigm: Mindset of code structure which will determine your coding style.

1.Procedural Programming.
2.OOP.
3.FP:Functional Programming.

### Prototyped-based:

prototype is kind of blueprint ,Like we use array.map right?
here js Array have Array.prototype.map , and Array's all methods like .pop .push .indexOF .shift etc inside this prototype.

### Functions are first class citizen:

It means you can throw function anywhere you want.
we can treat function as a variable. We can pass function as a parameter of a function.
we can return function from inside of another function .This feature gives us a lot of flexibility while using function.

### Dynamically Typed:

We don't need to specify the type of the variable on the declaration,
because they decide the type on runtime .
But if we use typeScript then we have to specify the type so that we can prevent
errors before runtime.

### Single Threaded:

Means the execution of instructions happens in a single sequence.
However, it can manage multitasking by leveraging browser APIs or, in the case of Node.js, utilizing our CPU threads.
